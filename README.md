Loadout makes developer machine setup painless & deterministic.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have the python version specified in `.python-version` installed via `pyenv`.
2. Run `make init-workspace`

## Tooling

- Loadout uses [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Python version management. The Pyenv reads the version to use from the `.python-version` file in the root of the repo (further reading: [Pyenv - Understanding Python Version Selection](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#understanding-python-version-selection)).
- Package management is handled by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Poetry uses the `python` provided by Pyenv to [create virtual environments](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/).
- We have a variety of tools to cover code quality
  - **Types:** Typing is handled by [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
  - **Linting:** We use both [Pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/#) & [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/). It was tough to find guidance on which one is the "right" linter, but some folks are [using both](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/82hgzm/comment/dva4521/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This may prove to be too restrictive or result in conflicts & need to be revisit. But for now that's the direction.
  - **Import sorting:** [Isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) manages our imports.
  - **Formatting:** You can format your code howerver you want "as long as it's [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  - **Security Analysis:** [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) performs static security analysis.
- We run tests using [pyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/). Coverage is generated by [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/)
- [debugpy](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy) allows debugging through VS Code.
- Git hooks are run by [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
- We use [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) to guide us as we write meaningful, expressive commit messages.
- Our git hooks are managed by [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
